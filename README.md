# Getting Started With Sonic Pi
I was inspired by a DJ on TikTok and started learning about Sonic Pi to try to create some cool tunes from my own bedroom!

<p2>The resources that I'm using to learn are https://projects.raspberrypi.org/, @ DJ_Dave on TikTok, and some miscellaneous YouTube Videos.</p2>


<p3>In the future, I want to learn more about TidalCycles in Haskell!</p3>
